# Outline:

- This segment of the text-based algorithms contain programs that run based on the principles of hashing. These programs, that tackle common string-based problems and form the backbone of modern string processing, are slightly more complex to wrap your head around at first owing to the multitude of new concepts but I shall try to break them down as simply as I can in the detailed description below!

# Purpose:

- I was introduced to the concept of using hashing to solve string-based programs through the Data Structures course in my Data Structures and Algorithms specialisation on Coursera offered by UCSD and HSE while we were tackling the implementation of hash-tables and the general concept of hashing.
- Hashing forms the backbone of modern computing (literally any mapping on any system uses hashing!) and has a number of applications in emerging areas too - Blockchain being one of them and string processing another and therefore I was immensely excited to understand its advantages and how to properly implement such a system.
- As mentioned above, hashing takes some time to wrap your head around as you can't often visualise a hash as you can a string or integer and while it took to me a number of Stackoverflow searches to arrive at some of these solutions, it was well worth it and now I am much better equipped to deal with a certain kind of problem! I hope I can explain this concept just as well.

# Description:

- I realise hashing sounds quite complex and seems like voodoo but let me try to break it down for you.
- First off, have you ever used a dictionary in the programming language of your choice? Well if yes, then congrats because you have unknowingly been using hashing for quite some time! (If no then maybe this post isn't for you... unless you've vowed never to use a dictionary in your life - then maybe you're welcome.)
- To help you understand hashing and these programs, I want to define a few things and explain some ideas and then you'll be able to understand how the concepts have been used to solve the programs!

### What is hashing anyway?
