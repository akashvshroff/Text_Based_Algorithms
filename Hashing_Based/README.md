# Outline:

- This segment of the text-based algorithms contain programs that run based on the principles of hashing. These programs, that tackle common string-based problems and form the backbone of modern string processing, are slightly more complex to wrap your head around at first owing to the multitude of new concepts but I shall try to break them down as simply as I can in the detailed description below!

# Purpose:

- I was introduced to the concept of using hashing to solve string-based programs through the Data Structures course in my Data Structures and Algorithms specialisation on Coursera offered by UCSD and HSE while we were tackling the implementation of hash-tables and the general concept of hashing.
- Hashing forms the backbone of a number of key areas in modern CS - Blockchain being one of them and string processing another and therefore I was immensely excited to understand its advantages and how to properly implement such a system.
- As mentioned above, hashing takes some time to wrap your head around as you can't often visualise a hash as you can a string or integer and while it took to me a number of Stackoverflow searches to arrive at some of these solutions, it was well worth it and now I am much better equipped to deal with a certain kind of problem! I hope I can explain this concept just as well.
